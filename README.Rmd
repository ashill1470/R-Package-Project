# RPackProj

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of RPackProj is to use `df_apply` function to deal with changing values of certain columns in a data frame. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of RPackProj from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: https://github.com/ashill1470/RPackProj

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ashill1470/RPackProj")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(RPackProj)

df <- data.frame(
  A = c(1, 2, 3),
  B = c(4, 5, 6),
  C = c("foo", "bar", "baz")
)

test_that("df_apply works", {
  expect_equal(
  df_apply(df, function(x) x * 2, function(x) is.numeric(x)),
  data.frame(
    A = c(2, 4, 6),
    B = c(8, 10, 12),
    C = c("foo", "bar", "baz")
  ))
})

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.


In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
